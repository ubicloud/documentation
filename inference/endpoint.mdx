Inference Endpoints offer OpenAI-compatible APIs, enabling effortless integration with existing systems while reducing the likelihood of vendor lock-in.
Privacy is a top priority for inference endpoints, as they neither store nor reuse user data.
Built on open-source, inference endpoints provide transparency in their operations and functionality.

The Inference Endpoints tab offers insights into usage, pricing, and the capabilities of each available endpoint.
