## Compute

Ubicloud virtual machines (VMs) come with dedicated CPU, memory, and local block storage. We use the name **standard** for our general purpose instance types.
- Pricing for standard instances in Hetzner's Finland region is as follows.
- Ubicloud prices for Hetzner's Germany region is 4.5% higher than those in Finland.

| Virtual Machine | vCPU | Memory | Storage |           Pricing           |
|:---------------:|:----:|:------:|:-------:|:---------------------------:|
|    standard-2   |   2  |   8GB  |   40GB  |  \$0.00063/min (\$25.40/mo) |
|    standard-4   |   4  |  16GB  |   80GB  |  \$0.00126/min (\$50.80/mo) |

|   standard-60   |  60  |  240GB |  1200GB | \$0.01890/min (\$762.00/mo) |

### Networking

Ubicloud creates each VM in a private subnet. For free, each VM gets a private IPv4 and IPv6 address. The VM also gets a public IPv6 address for free. For a public IPv4 address, we charge \$3.00/month pro-rated per minute. You can opt out of getting a public IPv4 when creating the VM.

Each VM has a monthly egress quota of 0.625TB per 2 vCPUs. If you exceed this limit, we will charge you \$3 per TB of egress traffic. We don't charge for ingress traffic or traffic between your resources within the same cloud region.
