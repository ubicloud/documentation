Ubicloud provides IaaS cloud features on bare metal providers, such as Hetzner, Leaseweb, or AWS Bare Metal. You can set it up yourself on these providers or use our managed service.

The pricing information below is for our managed service. Billing is based on the resources provisioned, pro-rated for the time they are provisioned. We calculate resource consumption at per minute granularity and bill monthly.

At a high level, our prices are 3-10x lower than comparable offerings. For example, 2 vCPU instance prices for different services are:

- [GitHub Actions](/pricing/github-actions): \$0.0008/min on Ubicloud vs. \$0.008/min on GitHub
