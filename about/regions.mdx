title: 'Regions'

Ubicloud managed services are offered through data centers of various bare metal providers, such as Hetzner and Leaseweb. We are adding new providers and regions based on demand. If you are interested specific regions, please contact us at [support@ubicloud.com](mailto:support@ubicloud.com).

Each Ubicloud region can be mapped to particular provider and its data center. Below you can find the mapping of existing Ubicloud regions.

|  Region Name  | Bare Metal Provider |       Location       |
|:-------------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------:|
| eu-central-h1 |       Hetzner       | Falkenstein, Germany |
|  eu-north-h1  |       Hetzner       |   Helsinki, Finland  |
|   us-east-a2  |       Leaseweb      |   Manassas, VA, US   |

### Github Action Runners

Github runners are automatically provisioned either at `eu-central-h1` or `eu-north-h1` regions based on the overall availability of the regions at the time of the provisioning.
