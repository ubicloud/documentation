_Customer content data is content which a Ubicloud customer transfers to us when using Ubicloud Services for processing or storage. It excludes customer account data (described below). Our customers own and control this data and we are generally unable to determine if a customer is processing personal data as part of its customer content data._

Customer content data for all Ubicloud managed services are processed within the region, where the resource was provisioned. For the GitHub Actions service, Ubicloud runners process data in Germany and Finland, with the exception that standard-60 runners may fall back to the USA in case of high traffic. If you need access to standard-60 runners, please get in touch with our team at [support@ubicloud.com](mailto:support@ubicloud.com).
