This Privacy Notice explains how Ubicloud B.V. and Ubicloud Inc. (“Ubicloud,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collect, use, share and otherwise process information that identifies or could be identifiable to you (“personal data”) when you interact with websites, applications and services that display or reference this notice (together, “Ubicloud Services”).

**This Privacy Notice does not apply to the “content” processed, stored or hosted by our customers using Ubicloud Services in connection with a Ubicloud account. As a customer, you own and control your content.**  See our [Terms of Service](/about/terms-of-service).

When you use third-party extensions, integrations, or follow references and links to third-party providers within Ubicloud Services (for example, when using Ubicloud runners for Github Actions) the privacy policies of these third parties apply to any personal data you provide or consent to share with them. Their privacy statements will govern how this data is processed.

## Personal data we collect

Personal data is collected from you directly, automatically from your device and also from third parties.  

When you register and use an account with us, we collect and process certain personal data from you including your name, email address, authentication credentials (if applicable) and, where relevant, company information. When you communicate with us via email or otherwise to use Ubicloud Services, for example when asking for support or giving feedback, you supply information to us which may also include personal data of yourself and/or those within your organization such as your name, email address, phone number and job title.  We may also collect personal data such as name, email address, job title and company information when you attend events or conferences and consent to provide us your personal data.  When you enter your billing information to use Ubicloud Services on our website, we do not collect or store any of your payment information as you disclose this information directly to our payment service provider, Stripe. However, we are able to access the following data you provide to Stripe: your name, email address, last four digits of your credit card number and credit card expiration date.

We receive personal data automatically. Examples of personal data we automatically collect include network and connection information such as your IP address and geographical location based on that IP address, information such as computer and device information including its geolocation, your service access times and statistics on page views and usage details.  

We collect anonymized statistics from third-party website analytics provider Matomo to help understand our website traffic and usage and tailor our marketing efforts. We may also receive your personal data from other users within your organization, publicly available sources, third parties like vendors, resellers or partners for purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice. 

## How we use your personal data

The primary purpose of collecting your personal data is to provide Ubicloud Services to you and process transactions related to these services such as registrations, purchases and payments for our services. In addition, we use your personal data to measure, provide, develop, customize and improve our Ubicloud Services and our business operations (such as use of aggregated data for internal reporting, product strategy and capacity planning). We also use your personal data to communicate with you for support, feedback, direct marketing or respond to your requests. In certain cases, we may use your personal data to comply with a legal obligation, or to detect or prevent fraud and abuse and analyze security incidents to protect safety and security across Ubicloud Services. 

We store personal data of all of our customers only in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). From time to time, your personal data may be accessed from outside of the EEA, including from the United States. Any such processing would be for the purposes outlined, and in compliance with, this Privacy Notice. If you'd like to find more about places of processing and security measures which we've taken to safeguard your personal data, please contact [info@ubicloud.com](mailto:info@ubicloud.com).

## How we share your personal data

Third-party service providers may have access to your personal data while they assist us in providing Ubicloud Services.

We take care in selecting the organizations that may handle personal data on our behalf, including reviewing their security posture and data protection policies. They are bound by contractual obligations towards us to ensure the security, privacy, and confidentiality of your information. 

Please visit [our sub-processors](/about/sub-processors) page for a list of our processor and sub-processors.

## Legal basis for processing your personal data

We may process personal data relating to you if one of the following applies: 
- Processing is required to fulfil our contractual duties to you in accordance with our Terms of Service.
- We process personal data when it's necessary to comply with applicable laws.  
- We process data for purposes that are in our legitimate interests, such as securing Ubicloud Services, communicating with you, and developing and improving Ubicloud Services.  
- We process personal data when you have explicitly consented to such processing. When we rely on consent as the legal basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent for data processing at any time; however, you may not be able to use some Ubicloud Services if you withdraw your consent.  

## How we secure and retain your personal data

We use appropriate technical, administrative and physical security controls to protect your personal data.  You can read about our security practices in [the general security page](/security/overview). 

We'll retain your personal data while you maintain an account with us, and for as long as required by the purpose for which we collected it.  Personal data which we collected relating to a contract will be retained until the contract has been fully performed by both parties. Personal data collected for our legitimate interests will be retained as long as needed to fulfil such purpose.  We may retain personal data for longer if you have given us consent for it or if we are required to do so to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes and enforce agreements.
