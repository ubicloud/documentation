We are here to help. We offer two types of support for our users and customers.

## Community Forums

All users and customers have access to [our community forum](https://github.com/ubicloud/ubicloud/discussions). This forum is best for general questions, troubleshooting, and best practices.

We're regularly in the forums to help out with customer issues and post new announcements. We'd also like the forums to grow and have customers help each other out.

## Email Support

If you're using our managed service, you also have access to email support. This channel is best for questions or issues that are specific to your account. If you need this type of help, you can reach us at [support@ubicloud.com](mailto:support@ubicloud.com).

If you need guaranteed response times or other enterprise level features, please contact us through email.
