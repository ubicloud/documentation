## What is Ubicloud?

Ubicloud is an open, free, and portable cloud. Think of it as an alternative to public cloud providers, like what Linux is to proprietary operating systems.

Ubicloud offers infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) features on providers that lease bare metal instances, such as Hetzner, Leaseweb, and Latitude.sh. Itâ€™s also available as a managed service.

The low cost of the bare metal instances we use in our managed service allows us to pass those low prices to you, reducing cloud costs by 3x - 10x.

## Why Ubicloud?

Cloud services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud made life easier for start-ups and enterprises. But they are closed source, have you rent computers at a huge premium, and lock you in. Ubicloud offers an open alternative, reduces your costs, and returns control of your infrastructure back to you. All without sacrificing the cloud's convenience.

Today, AWS offers about two hundred cloud services. Ultimately, we will implement 10% of the cloud services that make up 80% of total consumption.

Example workloads/reasons to use Ubicloud today include:
- You're using GitHub Actions. Ubicloud supports managed x64 and arm64 runners; and reduces your bill by 10x. To get started, you just need to change 1 line in your workflow file.
- You need managed PostgreSQL. Ubicloud is open source and portable. This way, you can see how we operate and avoid cloud vendor lock-in. Our managed Postgres is also fast thanks to its use of local NVMe and costs 3x less than comparable solutions.
- You have batch processing workloads that are compute/memory intensive. For example, you're doing scientific computing or video processing. You need secure virtual machines (VMs), encryption in-transit and at-rest; and you'd like to pay 3x less.
