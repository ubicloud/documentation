## Limitations

While Ubicloud Kubernetes offers numerous advantages, it currently has the following limitations:

- **Preview**: Ubicloud Kubernetes is currently in public beta. For feedback, feature requests, or support inquiries, please contact us at support@ubicloud.com.
- **Persistent Volumes**: Persistent volumes are not yet supported.
- **Single Load Balancer**: Each Kubernetes cluster is limited to one load balancer for exposing services to the internet. This means multiple services cannot share the same port.
