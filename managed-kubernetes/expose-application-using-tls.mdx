title: 'Expose an Application Securely Using TLS'
---

In this guide, we'll walk through the standard process of deploying a simple HTTP server secured with TLS and exposed via Ingress.

To securely deploy your applications on Ubicloud Kubernetes clusters using TLS, simply set up an Ingress controller along with Cert-Manager. This setup handles all your TLS needs.

Follow this step-by-step guide to deploy and expose an HTTPS application on your Kubernetes cluster. Before you begin, ensure that Helm is installed on your system.

### Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, Helm must be installed. You can follow the official installation guide available on the [Helm website](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

You’ll also need an active domain and access to the control panel for managing DNS records in order to complete this guide.

### Installing the required addons
You'll need an email to register yourself with letsencrypt.
```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/kubeconfig
export CLUSTER_ISSUER_EMAIL=email@yourcompany.com
```

Next, we'll add the ingress-nginx and jetstack Helm repositories to install the Ingress NGINX Controller and Cert Manager.

```bash
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update

helm install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx -n ingress-nginx --create-namespace
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --create-namespace --set crds.enabled=true
```

We'll also create a ClusterIssuer in order to get certificates from letsencrypt for our service
```bash
kubectl apply -f <(cat <<EOF
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
 name: letsencrypt
spec:
 acme:
   server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
   email: $CLUSTER_ISSUER_EMAIL
   privateKeySecretRef:
     name: letsencrypt
   solvers:
   - http01:
       ingress:
         class: nginx
EOF
)
```
Once all the commands have been executed, you’ll notice a Service named `ingress-nginx-controller` created in the `ingress-nginx` namespace. This Service is of type LoadBalancer, and the `EXTERNAL-IP` column will display a domain that resolves to the IPs of your worker nodes.

You can see this service using the command below
```bash
kubectl -n ingress-nginx get service ingress-nginx-controller
```

Here's a sample output of the command:
```
NAME                       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                            PORT(S)                      AGE
ingress-nginx-controller   LoadBalancer   10.105.61.236   xgmdaw248d-services.k8s.ubicloud.com   80:32271/TCP,443:30363/TCP   8m15s
```

### Add DNS record to route the traffic to the cluster
Next, create a CNAME record with your DNS provider pointing *.ingress.yourdomain.com to the domain listed in the EXTERNAL-IP. Feel free to use any subdomain that best suits your setup.

### Deploy your application
```bash
export DOMAIN_SUFFIX=ingress.yourdomain.com

kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
 name: hello-world-deployment
spec:
 replicas: 1
 selector:
   matchLabels:
     app: hello-world
 template:
   metadata:
     labels:
       app: hello-world
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: hello-world
       image: nginx
       ports:
       - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
 name: hello-world-service
spec:
 selector:
   app: hello-world
 ports:
 - port: 80
EOF

kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
 name: hello-world
 annotations:
   cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt
spec:
 ingressClassName: nginx
 tls:
 - hosts:
   - hello-world.$DOMAIN_SUFFIX
   secretName: hello-world-ingress-tls
 rules:
 - host: hello-world.$DOMAIN_SUFFIX
   http:
     paths:
     - path: /
       pathType: Prefix
       backend:
         service:
           name: hello-world-service
           port:
             number: 80
EOF
```

Now you can visit https://hello-world.ingress.yourdomain.com!
