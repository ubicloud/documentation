In this guide, you’re going to, create a Kubernetes cluster, connect to your cluster using `kubectl`, deploy a sample app and expose it to public. For this dedicated cluster, you’ll pay about 3x lower than you would with AWS or Azure.

### Navigate to Kubernetes Service
From the left menu on the console and select the **Kubernetes** option and click on the **Create Kubernetes Cluster** button. This will take you to a new page where you can select the cluster details.

### Configure the Cluster
- Enter your desired cluster name.
- Select the preferred location.
- Choose the specifications for the control plane and worker node pools.

### Launch the Cluster
After completing the configuration, click the **Create** button. Your Kubernetes cluster will be up and running in a few minutes based on the specified size.

### Download the kubeconfig
Once the `Download` button appears, click it to download the kubeconfig file. Then, run the following command to start using it:
```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
```

Kubernetes clients like [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) will automatically use this file to connect to your cluster. Check the connection with the following command:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### Create an Nginx deployment
Use the following command to deploy the Nginx application
```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
EOF
```

### Expose the Application
Use the following command to expose your Nginx deployment via a LoadBalancer service
```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - port: 80
EOF
```

### Access Your Application
Run the following command to retrieve the external domain assigned to your LoadBalancer service
```bash
kubectl get service nginx
```
Look for the `EXTERNAL-IP` or the Service URL in the cluster's panel. This URL sits behind a load balancer and it takes about a minute for it to become available. Once it does, you can access your application by opening up this URL in your browser
