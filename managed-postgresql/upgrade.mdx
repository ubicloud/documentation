## Preparing for a Major Version Upgrade

Before starting an upgrade, it is recommended to test the upgrade on a
staging database along with your application to ensure compatibility. 
Use the "Create a test fork" button to create a new copy of your
database at the current version. This will allow you to test the upgrade
without any risk to the current database.

## Upgrade Process

For performing the upgrade, click on the "Upgrade" button. During the upgrade,
your database will be unavailable for a short period. If a maintenance window
is configured, the upgrade will take place during the first available
maintenance window after the new server is ready. Otherwise, the upgrade will
be performed as soon as the new server becomes ready. While the upgrade is
ongoing, you can monitor the progress and the database availability status from
the Upgrade view.
