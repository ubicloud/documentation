You can change the configuration parameters of your Ubicloud PostgreSQL instance
by using the Configuration view. Here, you can configure both PostgreSQL and
PgBouncer parameters.

## Changing Configuration Parameters

To configure a new parameter, enter the paramter name and value in the new key
and value input fields.  Confirm the addition by clicking the "Save" button. You
can add multiple parameters in one go by using the "+" button.

To change a configuration parameter, change the key or value in the input
fields.  You can also reset a parameter to its default value by clicking the
"Delete" button next to it. Confirm your changes by clicking the "Save" button.

We support configuring basically all PostgreSQL and PgBouncer parameters. For a
list of supported parameters, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config.html)
and the [PgBouncer documentation](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html).

All changes made to the configuration parameters are typically persisted to the
instance within one minute. If modifying a parameter requires a restart of the
database server, the change will be applied after the next restart. You
can trigger a restart manually from the Settings view, described below.

## Instance Settings

The Settings view allows you to setup maintenance windows, update superuser
password, restart or delete the Ubicloud PostgreSQL instance.

### Maintenance Windows

Maintenance Windows are periods during which Ubicloud can perform maintenance
tasks on your instance. This can be used to decrease the impact of maintenance
tasks like resizing on your database.

You can set up a maintenance window by selecting a 2-hour window from the
provided dropdown. The time window uses the UTC timezone.
