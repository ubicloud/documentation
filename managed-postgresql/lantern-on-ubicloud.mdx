title: 'Lantern on Ubicloud'
---

## Getting Started

Lantern is a PostgreSQL-based vector database designed specifically for building AI applications and now it is available on Ubicloud as a managed service.

Our managed Lantern service combines the unique expertise of both Ubicloud and Lantern teams. Underlying infrastructure is managed by the Ubicloud team and the Lantern instances are managed by the Lantern team. This allows you to access both teams' technical expertise as needed.

Lantern is a good fit for:
- Developers building AI-powered search, recommendation systems, or similarity matching features who want the power of vector search with the familiarity of PostgreSQL
- Teams looking to reduce cloud costs for their vector database workloads without sacrificing performance or ease of use

**Navigate to Lantern Service:** To create a Lantern instance, start by clicking to the "PostgreSQL" option from the left menu on the dashboard and then click “Create Lantern PostgreSQL Database”.

**Instance Configuration:** Type the desired database server name and choose the desired instance type. Since this database will be managed by the Lantern team as well, you will need to accept terms of service and privacy policy of Lantern. You don't need to set anything else. A secure password will be automatically generated.

**Instance Creation:** After selecting the instance type, click the "Create" button. Your managed PostgreSQL instance will be set up and ready for use in a few minutes.

## Connect to managed Lantern instance

**Get Connection Details:** Once your Lantern instance is ready, go to the database details view to find the connection string. The connection string will be masked. You can reveal it or copy it to your clipboard directly..

**Use Connection String:** You can use `psql` or any other database client to establish a connection to your PostgreSQL instance.

Ubicloud managed Lantern service provides superuser access to users. This connection string is for accessing the database as a superuser. You can use it to create new users.
