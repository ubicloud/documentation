title: 'Metric Destinations'
---

It is possible to send various metrics such as CPU usage, disk IO, database locks from your database to external targets. Metrics destinations use Prometheus’ remote-write protocol to send metrics. Any destination that supports remote-write protocol, can be used as a destination of Ubicloud PostgreSQL metrics. You can find destinations that support remote-write protocol [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage).

## Setting Up
Setting up a metric destination is easy. Just open the PostgreSQL server details page. You can enter connection details of the remote destination in the “Metric Destinations” section.

We need 3 pieces of information; URL for sending metrics to, and also username/password for authentication. We only accept https:// endpoints. In this way we ensure that the data we are sending is encrypted at transit.

## Type of Metrics

We are sending two types of metrics:
- **Metrics from the database itself:** Database metrics are collected by [postgres_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter). It contains information about database size, active connections, write/read activity, replication, WAL archival, autovacuum and many more.
- **Metrics from the underlying virtual machine:** Virtual machine metrics are collected by [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter). It contains information about CPU usage, disk IO, filesystem usage, memory consumption and network transfe
