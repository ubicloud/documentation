title: 'Read Replicas'

Read replicas allow you to create one or more copies of your primary PostgreSQL database instance. These replicas continuously follow your primary database using replication mechanisms of PostgreSQL to stay up to date with changes. With Ubicloud, you can now spin up read replicas with a single click from the Read Replica view of your PostgreSQL instance.

## Why Read Replicas Matter?

- **Scalability:** Read replicas allow you to scale your database horizontally, distributing read-heavy workloads-such as reporting, analytics, and real-time dashboards-across multiple dedicated replicas.
- **Isolation:** By directing analytical and business intelligence queries to these replicas, you keep your primary instance focused and responsive for write operations and critical transactional workloads. This separation not only boosts overall system performance and predictability but also ensures that you don't need to give write access to analytical or reporting tools.
- **Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR):** Read replicas can play a critical role in case of a primary database failure, a read replica can be promoted to primary, ensuring minimal downtime and data loss.
