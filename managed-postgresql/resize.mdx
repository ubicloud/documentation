title: 'Resizing'
---

Resizing your Ubicloud PostgreSQL instance allows you to adjust the resources
allocated to your database to better meet your performance and cost
requirements. You can resize your instance by changing to a different
configuration of server family, server size and storage size.

After selecting the desired configuration, click the "Update" button to start
the resizing process. The resizing process may take some time to complete,
depending on the size of your database and the resources allocated to your
instance.

Once the process is complete, your instance will failover to the desired
configuration. This involves a brief interruption during which the database will
be unavailable. If a [maintenance window](/managed-postgresql/configuration-and-settings#maintenance-windows) is configured, the failover will be
scheduled for the next available maintenance window, otherwise it will be
done immediately.

There will be no changes to the connection information after resizing.
