Ubicloud PostgreSQL instances are accessible over the internet by default. To
restrict connections to your database based on the IP address of the client, you
can set up Firewall Rules in the Networking view.

## Adding and Modifying Firewall Rules

Firewall rules define a range of IP addresses that are allowed to connect to your
database. You can add multiple firewall rules to allow connections from different
IP ranges.

To modify an existing firewall rule, click the "Edit" button next to it, change
the IP range and description as needed and confirm the change.
You can also delete a firewall rule by clicking the "Delete" button next to it.
To add a new firewall rule, enter the IP range and description and click the
"Create" button.

Any changes made to the firewall rules should typically take effect within a minute.
