## Platform

### Web Shell

You can now run `ubi` CLI commands directly from your browser with the new Web Shell. This feature provides a convenient way to manage your resources without needing to install the CLI on your local machine. All commands are available, except for those that execute local programs (like `psql` or `ssh`). The Web Shell uses your existing web session for authentication, so there's no need to create a personal access token.

### Retouched UI for All Resources

The modern tabbed user interface, previously available only for PostgreSQL, has now been rolled out to all other resources: Firewalls, Kubernetes Clusters, Load Balancers, Private Subnets, and VMs. This creates a consistent and organized experience for managing settings, networking, and overview information across the platform.

### Rename Resources via API and CLI

You can now rename existing resources using the API and CLI. The new `rename` command is available for Firewalls, Kubernetes clusters, Load Balancers, PostgreSQL instances, Private Subnets, and VMs, making it easier to manage your infrastructure as code.

### Major CLI Usability Improvements

The `ubi` CLI is now more user-friendly and powerful for scripting. You can now use resource **names** instead of IDs for many commands (e.g., `lb attach-vm my-load-balancer --vm-name my-vm`), eliminating the need to parse output to get IDs. We have also fixed issues with interactive commands like `psql` and `ssh` and improved overall argument flexibility.

## Managed PostgreSQL

### Expanded CLI Functionality

The `ubi pg` command set has been significantly enhanced with support for new features. You can now manage read replicas (`create-read-replica`, `promote-read-replica`), modify database and PGBouncer configurations (`show-config`, `add-config-entries`), set maintenance windows, and manage firewall rules directly from the command line. For improved security, the CLI now uses the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable for command execution.

### Tagging

You can now add resource tags to your PostgreSQL instances via the API to help with organization and cost management.

## Ubicloud Kubernetes

### Kubernetes 1.34 Support

We now support Kubernetes v1.34 for new cluster deployments. When creating a new cluster, v1.34 will be available as an option. Support for v1.32 has been deprecated and removed.

### Dual-Stack Load Balancers for Services

The default load balancer created for Kubernetes services (`type: LoadBalancer`) now supports dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) networking, improving connectivity and future-proofing your applications.
