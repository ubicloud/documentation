## Managed Github Runners

### Transparent cachingÂ now available for Github runners

This feature improves your GitHub Actions cache and Docker caching performance by 4x, without changing the caching instructions.

You can enable it by just clicking a button on the Ubicloud console: Integrations > Github Runners > Github Runner Settings > Enable Ubicloud Cache. ([Blog post](https://www.ubicloud.com/blog/github-actions-transparent-cache))

## APIs

### OpenAPI schema updated; and now enforced

We updated the OpenAPI schema to align with latest backend changes. Going forward, alignment between OpenAPI schema and backend is also now enforced, through the use of [committee](https://github.com/interagent/committee).

### API reference updated with sample responses and interactive playground

See here for examples and the playground:

## New project dashboard

This redesign of our main dashboard in the Ubicloud console includes a more intuitive layout, allowing you to quickly view a summary of your project's resources at a glance. Additionally, we've added detailed "Getting Started" links to help you navigate your project with ease. ([PR #2381](https://github.com/ubicloud/ubicloud/pull/2381))
