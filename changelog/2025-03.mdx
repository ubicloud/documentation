## Burstable VM Family (new)

We are excited to introduce a new family of VMs: **Burstables**. These small instances provide a fraction of shared vCPU and offer the ability to utilize more CPU for occasionally expanding workloads. Burstable VMs are available for Ubicloud Compute and Postgres, with starting prices as low as \$6.65/month for VMs and \$13/month for Postgres.

### Re-size Postgres instance memory, cpu and disk via console/API
Scaling the compute and storage of a Postgres instance on the fly is possible. Updating your instance specifications triggers the creation of a new standby with the updated specs, followed by a failover to ensure seamless and secure scaling.

### Burstable option, starting from \$0.02 per hour / \$13 per month  
The burstable VM family is available for Postgres instances, offering compute options of 1 vCPU with 2 GB RAM or 2 vCPUs with 4 GB RAM, bursting under load. With storage starting at 16 GB, pricing begins at just** \$13 per month.**
