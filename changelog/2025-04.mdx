Create as many read replicas for your PostgreSQL databases to balance read workloads and promote them to standalone writable instances any time.

### You can manage the maintenance window
Select the 2-hour window for performing the operations in the least disruptive time for your database.

### High availability is datacenter-aware now
Standbys for high availability mode are now placed in different data centers in the  eu-central-h1 region for improved durability.

### Multiple PGBouncer instances are deployed, for faster transactions
Postgres instances are deployed with multiple pgbouncer instances, depending on the instance size, for improved parallelism in transactional workloads.

### PostgreSQL 17 is the default
Now Ubicloud Postgres defaults to PostgreSQL 17, with the option to select PostgreSQL 16.
