## Managed PostgreSQL
### Read Replicas
Create as many read replicas for your PostgreSQL databases to balance read workloads. Promote them to standalone writable instances at any time.

### Manage your maintenance window
Select the 2-hour time window that is the least disruptive for your database where maintenance operations can be performed.

### High availability is now datacenter-aware
Standbys for high availability mode are now placed in different data centers in the eu-central-h1 region for improved durability.

### Multiple PGBouncer instances for faster transactions
Postgres instances are deployed with multiple pgbouncer instances, depending on the instance size, for improved parallelism in transactional workloads.

### PostgreSQL 17 is the default
Now Ubicloud Postgres defaults to PostgreSQL 17, with the option to select PostgreSQL 16.
