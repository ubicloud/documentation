You can now use our OpenAI compatible API endpoints through AI Inference on Ubicloud console. 

### 7 open source LLM and embedding models

- Ds-r1-qwen-32b (Text-generation) 
- llama-3-1-8b-it
- Llama-3-2-3b-it
- Llama-3-3-70b-it

<Note> Models are priced between \$0.10 - \$0.60 per million tokens </Note>
<Tip>
  {" "}
  Ubicloud API endpoints cost ~10x less when compared to OpenAI models at \$4.40
  - \$10.00. While different models, the open source models provide notable
  performance for their price.{" "}

<Note>
  Ubicloud standard-2 PostgreSQL instances now cost below \$50 per month.{" "}
</Note>

<Tip>
  {" "}
  This is 4x lower than AWS RDS, while also delivering better performance,
  driven by new hardware and NVMe disks.{" "}
</Tip>

### Minimum disk size reduced from 128 GB to 64 GB

### Larger storage options introduced also in the US

<Note>
  {" "}
  For large storage options in PostgreSQL that exceed 16 TB, please contact us
  via support.{" "}
</Note>

### Download PostgreSQL CA certs from Ubicloud console

This makes it easier to verify certs via SSL for more secure connections.

### ParadeDB new images: v0.14.1

## Simplified fine-grained access controls

Ubicloud comes with granular access controls that can be assigned to each user, for different resources. These Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) can now be managed much more simply through the console.

### Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) managed via console

### Step-by-step guide to user permissions & API access management

With major changes to how authorization is managed, we created a detailed documentation page, with example scenarios: [https://www.ubicloud.com/docs/security/authorization](https://www.ubicloud.com/docs/security/authorization)

### Granular access extended to APIs via personal access tokens

With these changes, we also deprecated our prior JSON based policy editor in the console.

## Managed Github Actions Runners

### Transparent Cache enabled by default for all new customers

We launched this feature last month, and given its favorable performance, now made it the default for all new accounts.

<Tip>
  {" "}
  Enabling transparent cache can speed up runs by 4x, without making any changes
  to your Github Actions caches.{" "}
</Tip>

### **Faster runner provisioning times via improved pools**

By optimizing the types of runners we pre-provision and keep ready for incoming jobs, we've cut down average runner provisioning times by a further 2+ seconds.

### Github Actions caches can now be accessible from all scopes of your Github Repos

This is not a common usage pattern, but can be helpful for certain projects.

<Note>
  {" "}
  This feature is behind a feature flag, please open a ticket to enable.{" "}

## VMs and Networking

### Simplified Load Balancer port mapping for private networking

Clients now just need to open up the private port for private subnet range.![](/changelog/2025-01-private-subnet-console.png)

### Load balancer stack (ipv4, ipv6 or dual) is selectable

This selection is available in both the UI and the API
