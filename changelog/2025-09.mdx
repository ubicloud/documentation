## Ubicloud Kubernetes

### Nodepool Resizing

You can now resize your Kubernetes cluster directly from the Ubicloud Console, API or CLI. This allows you to dynamically adjust the number of worker nodes in your cluster to match workload demands.

## Managed PostgreSQL

### Default IPv6 Connectivity

PostgreSQL databases now support IPv6 connections by default. A firewall rule for `::/0` is automatically included, allowing you to connect to your databases over IPv6 without extra configuration.

### Advanced Firewall Configuration

You can now create a PostgreSQL database without any default firewall rules using the `--restrict-by-default` flag in the CLI or API. This allows for a more secure, locked-down setup where you can add only the specific access rules you need.

### ParadeDB Update

The ParadeDB extension has been updated to version 0.17.10, bringing the latest features and improvements for real-time search and analytics on PostgreSQL.

### Rename Resources in the UI

You can now rename your resourcesâ€”including VMs, PostgreSQL databases, Kubernetes Clusters, Load Balancers, and Firewalls directly from their settings page in the UI. When renaming a database or load balancer, DNS records and SSL certificates are automatically refreshed to ensure seamless service when needed.

### Pre-Authorization Charge Notice

To improve clarity, we've added a notice to the payment method success page explaining that a temporary pre-authorization charge may appear on your credit card and will be refunded.
