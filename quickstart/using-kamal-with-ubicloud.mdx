title: 'Using Kamal with Ubicloud'
description: 'Kamal is an open source tool to deploy web apps anywhere. It simplifies the process of deploying and managing your web app in production with Docker.'
---

Even with Kamal, you still need certain infrastructure primitives, including virtual machines and managed databases. Ubicloud offers these primitives on the cloud. We believe the combination of Kamal and Ubicloud provide a compelling open source web app deployment platform.

In this guide, we'll show steps for configuring an example Rails 8 application in a way that allows you to use Kamal 2 to deploy it to Ubicloud.

### Step 1: Install Kamal

First, we need to install Rails and Kamal. Assuming you have Ruby installation in your local machine, run:

```bash
gem install -N rails kamal
```

### Step 2: Create a Simple Rails App

Next, create a basic Rails app using PostgreSQL as the database and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and generate a scaffold:

```bash
rails new blog -d postgresql -c tailwind
cd blog
rails generate scaffold post title:string content:text
```

Commit the generated application, so you can easily tell the changes you will be making from the defaults:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: rails new and rails generate scaffold post"
```

### Step 3: Configure Routes

Set the root route to serve the `/posts` endpoint by updating `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
root "posts#index"
```

### Step 4: Set Up Docker Registry

Now, we need to set up a dockerhub repository to store and fetch our images. For that, you need to create an account at [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com).
Once you have the account, please create a new repository named “blog” in the docker hub page and generate a new key at [https://app.docker.com/settings/personal-access-tokens](https://app.docker.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) and paste it to the .env file as shown below.

```bash
KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=DOCKER_REGISTRY_KEY
```

Update `.kamal/secrets` to copy the key from the environment:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL
```

Configure the `config/deploy.yml` file to make it load from `.env`, and include your docker registry and the service names in place:

```yaml
<% require "dotenv"; Dotenv.load(".env") %>

service: blog

image: YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY_NAME/blog

registry:
  username: YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY_NAME
```

### Step 5: Set Up Ubicloud Resources

Create the following resources:

- **Virtual Machines (VMs):** Create a VM from console.ubicloud.com. When creating the VM, you need to pay attention to three things:
    - For the location, pick Germany. Later, we're going to provision a managed Postgres in the same region.
    - Make sure to include an IPv4 address, as Kamal 2 will have deployment issues in IPv6 only environments.
    - Change the user from `ubi` to `root`. We use `root` because Kamal installs Docker and connects to it on the VMs. Using `root` avoids the need to manage users and groups.

- **Managed PostgreSQL Database:** Set up a managed PostgreSQL database.

### Step 6: Gather Resource Information

After setting up the resources, collect the following information from the Ubicloud Console:

- **PostgreSQL Connection String:** Shown by clicking on the database name on the PostgreSQL page
- **Public IP of the VM:** Shown in the IP Address column on the Compute page

### Step 7: Configure Kamal and Environment Variables

Next, copy the master key from `config/master.key` and paste it into the `.env` file:

```bash
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=YOUR_MASTER_KEY
```

Add the PostgreSQL connection string to the `.env` file:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:password@hostname/?channel_binding=require"
```

Configure server IP address to deploy to in `config/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
servers:
 web:
   hosts:
     - IP
```

Rails 8's Kamal 2 configuration defaults to an HTTPS-only application, using certificates from Let's Encrypt, so you need to edit the `config/deploy.yml` file to set the hostname for the application:

```yaml
proxy:
  ssl: true
  host: your-host.your-domain.com
```

You will need to create or update your DNS records so that the hostname you are using resolves to the IP address of the VM you created.  How you do this depends on your DNS provider.

Update `config/deploy.yml` to pass the environment variables:

```yaml
env:  
 secret:
   - RAILS_MASTER_KEY
   - DATABASE_URL
```

Modify `config/database.yml` to use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, which will already contain the user, password and the database name:

```yaml
production:
 <<: *default
 url: <%= ENV["DATABASE_URL"] %>
```

### Step 8: Deploy the Application

Commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Changes to allow deploying to Ubicloud using Kamal"
```

Run Kamal setup, which will setup Docker on the VM you created, and then deploy your application to it:

```bash
kamal setup
```

### Step 9: Enjoy Your HTTPS-Enabled Rails App

Visit the DNS name you configured and enjoy your newly deployed, secure Rails app!

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate Kamal with Ubicloud services to deploy your web applications efficiently and securely. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to our support team.

### Step 10: Deploying Changes After Initial Setup

After making and committing changes in your application, you can deploy them using:

```bash
kamal deploy
```
