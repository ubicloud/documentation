title: 'Use Premium Runners'
---

Ubicloud Premium Runners are powered by AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPUs, high-performance gaming processors optimized for single-thread speed and fast CI execution.

They're ideal for large monorepos, test-heavy workflows, or any job that benefits from high CPU clock speeds.

## Why use Premium Runners?

- Up to 2x faster build times thanks to AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPUs
- 1/5th the price of GitHub-hosted runners ([Pricing](/about/pricing#github-actions))
- 10x better price-performance
- 10 Gbit/s networking and ultra-fast NVMe storage  

Ubicloud Premium Runners are ephemeral, isolated, and fully compatible with all GitHub Actions workflows. You can continue to use matrix builds, Docker-based actions, caching, and everything else you use today, just faster.

## How to enable Premium Runners

Premium Runners are enabled at the account level. Once enabled, we'll start routing your jobs to our premium fleet automatically. No changes needed in your workflow files.

1. Go to the [Ubicloud Console](https://console.ubicloud.com/)
2. Navigate to **GitHub Runners** → **Settings**
3. Toggle on **Enable Premium Runners**

That's it. Your jobs will now run on high-performance CPUs.

## Why Faster Builds Matter

Build and test jobs don't just consume compute, they block developer time.

When a developer pushes code and waits 15–20 minutes for CI to complete, that's time spent:

- Waiting to merge a pull request  
- Context-switching to other work  
- Losing momentum on the task at hand  

Now multiply that across an engineering team. Even **saving 3–5 minutes per job** adds up to:

- Dozens of hours per week in recovered dev time  
- Fewer PRs left idle due to slow feedback  
- Faster iteration on features and bug fixes  
- Higher team velocity, fewer productivity stalls

> **Example**: If your team runs 1,000 jobs/week and Premium Runners cut job time by 4 minutes on average, that's over **66 hours of developer time saved every month**.

Ubicloud Premium Runners aren't just about faster CI, they're about giving your engineers back their time so they can build, ship, and move faster.
