title: 'Runner Types'
---

Ubicloud offers a wide variety of runner types and sizes, allowing you to choose based on your specific needs.

By default, using `runs-on: ubicloud` provisions a 2 vCPU x64 Ubuntu 24.04 runner. You can specify the runner size, for example, `runs-on: ubicloud-standard-8` provisions an 8 vCPU runner. You can even specify the operating system, such as `runs-on: ubicloud-standard-4-ubuntu-2204`, which provisions a 4 vCPU runner with Ubuntu 22.04.

Ubicloud runners support the following label patterns:

```yaml
# x64 runners
runs-on: ubicloud-standard-{vcpu}-{os}
# ubicloud                        -> 2 vCPU x64 Ubuntu 24.04 runner
# ubicloud-standard-8             -> 8 vCPU x64 Ubuntu 24.04 runner
# ubicloud-standard-4-ubuntu-2204 -> 4 vCPU x64 Ubuntu 22.04 runner

# arm64 runners
runs-on: ubicloud-standard-{vcpu}-arm-{os}
# ubicloud-arm                        -> 2 vCPU arm64 Ubuntu 24.04 runner
# ubicloud-standard-8-arm             -> 8 vCPU arm64 Ubuntu 24.04 runner
# ubicloud-standard-4-arm-ubuntu-2204 -> 4 vCPU arm64 Ubuntu 22.04 runner
```

<Warning>
  **Deprecation of GPU runners**: We will be deprecating our GPU runners, effective December 31, 2025. After this date, GPU runners will no longer be available, and any jobs on these runners will need to be migrated to other runner types
</Warning>

## x64 Runners

Ubicloud x64 **standard runners** are powered by AMD EPYC 9454P processors, with every two x64 vCPUs corresponding to one physical core. All Ubicloud runners are equipped with modern hardware, including new generation processors, NVMe SSDs, and high-speed networking. This enables us to deliver better price-performance across our services.

For our customers who seek even higher performance, we offer **premium runners** powered by AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPUs. These processors are optimized for single-thread speed and fast CI execution, making them ideal for large monorepos, test-heavy workflows, or any job that benefits from high CPU clock speeds. Learn how to enable premium runners [here](/github-actions-integration/use-premium-runners).

Our x64 runner images are fully compatible with default runners. We generate them using the official HashiCorp packer templates published by GitHub in the [actions/runner-images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) repository.

We update the images monthly after GitHub releases a new version. We don't deploy new images on the same day as GitHub to avoid potential issues. In the past, GitHub has encountered problems with new images and had to quickly rollback.

To prevent any disruption to our customers, we typically deploy new images a few days after GitHub's deployment is complete.

If you notice any mismatches between Ubicloud x64 runners and the official GitHub runners, please reach out to us at support@ubicloud.com.

If your workflow has a package dependency that doesn’t exist on Ubicloud’s image, we recommend installing the dependency manually for the time being or creating an issue at [actions/runner-images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) repository.

## arm64 Runners

Ubicloud arm64 runners are powered by Ampere Altra Q80-30 processors, with each arm64 vCPU backed by a dedicated physical core. This ensures consistent, high-performance computing for your workloads.

GitHub launched official arm64 runners at the beginning of 2025. However, GitHub doesn't create arm64 images; their partner does. Unfortunately, they don't publish a packer template like the one for x64 images. As a result, Ubicloud builds its own Ubuntu arm64 image, and our arm64 runners don’t have all the pre-installed packages that are available on x64.

Arm shares a list of installed packages in the [actions/partner-runner-images](https://github.com/actions/partner-runner-images) repository, and we try to keep it similar. However, our images might not be identical to GitHub's arm64 images since they don't share the exact template and versions.

If your workflow has a package dependency that doesn’t exist on Ubicloud’s arm64 image, we recommend installing the dependency manually for the time being.

If you need commonly used packages on arm64 that are already installed on x64, please contact us at support@ubicloud.com.

## Ubuntu 24.04 Migration

On November 23, 2025, we updated the default operating system for Ubicloud runners from Ubuntu 22.04 to Ubuntu 24.04.

GitHub changed the default version of the `ubuntu-latest` label from Ubuntu 22.04 to Ubuntu 24.04 in [early 2025](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/10636). We waited for the Ubuntu 24 image to mature before making the switch.

All jobs using the labels `ubicloud`, `ubicloud-standard-2`, `ubicloud-standard-4`, `ubicloud-standard-8`, `ubicloud-standard-16`, `ubicloud-standard-30`, `ubicloud-standard-60`, `ubicloud-arm`, `ubicloud-standard-2-arm`, `ubicloud-standard-4-arm`, `ubicloud-standard-8-arm`, `ubicloud-standard-16-arm`, `ubicloud-standard-30-arm` or `ubicloud-standard-60-arm` now run on Ubuntu 24.04.

If your workflow depends on a specific Ubuntu version, we recommend explicitly specifying the operating system in the runner label.

To continue using Ubuntu 22.04, specify the version in the label. For example, use `ubicloud-standard-2-ubuntu-2204` instead of `ubicloud-standard-2`.

Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 24.04 include similar pre-installed software, but version differences may exist. You can find the lists of pre-installed software for [Ubuntu 22.04](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/ubuntu/Ubuntu2204-Readme.md) and [Ubuntu 24.04](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/ubuntu/Ubuntu2404-Readme.md) in GitHub’s repository.
