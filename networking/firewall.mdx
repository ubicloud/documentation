This guide provides detailed instructions on configuring and managing firewalls
for your private subnets within Ubicloud. Ubicloud firewalls are designed to
enhance the security of your virtual machines (VMs) by controlling inbound
traffic based on predefined rules. These firewalls are stateful and apply
exclusively to the entire private subnet, ensuring a robust security perimeter
for your whole private subnet.

## Key Features

- **Stateful Inspection:** Ubicloud firewalls remember the state of network
  connections (TCP/UDP) and can make decisions based on the connection state,
  which adds an extra layer of security. That said, if you add a rule that
  blocks a certain IP address, the existing connections would continue to stay
  alive until shutdown deliberately.
- **Ingress Filtering:** Firewalls in Ubicloud only allow inbound traffic based
  on explicitly defined rules. If no rules are specified, all inbound traffic is
  blocked except for communication within the private subnet. We currently do
  not support outbound rules.
- **Simplified Management:** Attach or detach one or more firewalls to your
  private subnet with ease, directly from the Ubicloud console.

## Getting Started with Firewalls

### Creating a Firewall

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Firewalls">
    On the dashboard, select the "Networking" option from the left menu. Then,
    select the "Firewalls" tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Firewall">
    Click on the "+ New Firewall" button. You will be prompted to enter details
    such as the firewall's name, description and the subnet you wish to attach.
    After filling the details, click “Create”.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configuring Firewall Rules

**Specify Ingress Rules:** Define which incoming traffic is allowed into your
private subnet. You can specify rules based on IP addresses and port numbers.
You can input a CIDR range and define the continuous port range to be allowed.
After specifying CIDR and Port ranges, you simply hit “Create”. Some example CIDR
and Port range usage can be like the following;

|                      Case                       |      CIDR       | Port Range |
| :---------------------------------------------: | :-------------: | :--------: |
|          Allow all IP and port ranges           |    0.0.0.0/0    |            |
|          Allow all IP and port ranges           |    0.0.0.0/0    |  0..65536  |
| Allow a specific IP and ports between 80 and 90 | 123.123.123.123 |   80..90   |
|       Allow a subnet for a specific port        |   1.1.1.0/24    |     22     |

**Default Deny Rule:** Remember, if no rules are set, the firewall will deny all
incoming traffic, including traffic within the private subnet.

### Attaching a Firewall to a Private Subnet

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Firewall Details">
    From the dashboard, select "Networking", choose the "Firewall" tab. Select
    the firewall you want to attach.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach to Subnet">
    Click on the "Select a Subnet" option, choose the private subnet and click
    “Attach”. This action applies the firewall rules to all incoming traffic in
    the subnet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices

**Regularly Update Firewall Rules:** As your network requirements change,
regularly review and update your firewall rules to ensure they accurately
reflect the desired traffic flow and security posture.

**‍Restrictive Rule Configuration:** Start with a restrictive approach by denying
all traffic and then selectively allow specific traffic as needed. This
minimizes potential exposure to unanticipated threats. By default, Ubicloud adds
allow all traffic rule to minimize the initial configuration efforts.

## How Does Ubicloud implement Firewalls?

Ubicloud firewalls are implemented using linux nftables. Please refer to our
